## Overview

### Screenshot

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Well, this is the first piece of CSS I've written in 10 years. My aim is to get back on track and in touch with styling,
so I can focus more on full-stack personal projects.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on writing a bit of CSS, then transition to Tailwind. My goal is to be able to comfortably
implement designs for my independent projects - from helping to set design systems to comfortably code apps.
